While interning for TeachOSM, I found myself asking the following question a few times: how did TeachOSM get started? After looking at the Wiki, and performing a few Google searches, I found the dates connected to the program -- its bare bones emerged in 2013, in 2016 the project was chartered by OpenStreetMap US, and it is now an official program of OSM US. Although these dates were informative, they do not tell the story of the educators who reached beyond their own classrooms and brought TeachOSM to teachers and those inclined to learn throughout the United States and across the world.

The story of TeachOSM involves many characters, people and organizations both, and is constantly growing. At its origins, however, there were three people of note who were foundational in the creation of the program. These people are Nuala Cowan, Richard Hinton, and Steven Johnson.

In 2013, Richard Hinton and Nuala Cowan were using OpenStreetMap in their GIS courses at the George Washington University (GWU), teaching handfuls of students about the program and its many uses. At the State of the Map US Conference that year in San Francisco, the two were approached by Steven Johnson, who was seeking better opportunities for the use of OSM in education. After talking, and discovering their shared interests, the three went on to present their ideas at the next geographic conference in Washington, D.C. during a Birds of a Feather session. At this conference, Richard and Nuala had also presented about their work with OSM in the classroom, and, as a result, were approached by teachers and faculty members wanting to implement similar learning in their own classrooms. Happy to facilitate more education, the pair reviewed syllabi, provided ideas, and spoke with many educators regarding how to integrate OSM into the classroom. This method was time consuming, and needed to be centralized. They created a blueprint for professors to follow, focusing initially on higher education due to the presented demand. Steven Johnson advocated for the creation of resources for people outside of higher education alone, to include high school classrooms, adult educational workshops -- for anyone who would like to learn, or teach.

By September of 2014, the three were meeting regularly on the George Washington University campus to discuss how they could develop a resource that educators at any level could use to teach others about OpenStreetMap. Mikel Maron, currently with The Earth Genome, attended one of these meetings, and mentioned that despite having already developed materials and resources, the group had no way of sharing it with others. To address this, a copy of LearnOSM was made, and after a night of going at GitHub, the group had a website. With the architecture taken care of, all of the resources the group had gathered and created had a new home. At this point, all of the resources on building up a class or creating a module were catered to higher education. To address this, Andrew Wiseman, who was a professor at GWU at the time and now works with Apple, contributed resources and write-ups that helped to encompass other means of education.

With resources and material available for learning both in and out of the classroom published, the group turned to its next hurdle -- a tasking manager.

Previously, group mapping was a difficult feat, calling for paper maps in a lab divided manually into a grid, with people annotating in different colored pens, with sticky notes, and however they could best think to contribute. This process was incredibly hands on, and relied on people not venturing outside of their own part of the map. One available alternative at the time was The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) Tasking Manager. This tasking manager is a great resource, and due to its important focus on humanitarian efforts, the quality of data is a significant concern. Because of this, not everyone can create projects and tasks using that manager, though organizations with legitimate reasons and claims can request access to do so. When an updated version of the HOT Tasking Manager was being implemented, the TeachOSM group decided to fork the tasking manager into two, allowing for the TeachOSM Tasking Manager's formation. The goal of this manager was to provide groups with a more relaxed environment to set up projects, teach, and learn, without having to contact people at the World Bank or USAID to ask if a task on the HOT Tasking Manager could be used to train people on how to map.

While the TeachOSM Tasking Manager makes facilitating group mapping projects easier for a variety of communities, the quality of data and edits are still of concern. To address this concern, the TeachOSM team is currently in the process of implementing a sandbox feature to the tasking manager. This would provide a space for learning where students are able to make mistakes without the consequence of bad data being uploaded to OpenStreetMap, allowing them to learn and grow with the OSM ecosystem before committing any edits to the world map.

When asked about the projects within TeachOSM that they were most proud of, Richard, Steven, and Nuala agreed that the continuation of TeachOSM was in itself the accomplishment. The success is found in the mundane, academics and YouthMappers chapters continue to use the resources written and shared by contributors to TeachOSM, and the TeachOSM tasking manager, to improve their skills and engage their communities in mapping. Over the past ten years, TeachOSM has grown and flourished. Community members have created a plethora of training modules and resources for beginner mappers, and those interested in more niche use of OSM alike. The program was able to fund a collaboration grant, carried out by PennWest University and Frostburg State University, in which Bill Wetherholt and Dr. Tom Mueller brought in new student learners and encouraged the mapping of Appalachia, a largely under-mapped region. These impressive feats will only accumulate as time goes on.

As for the future of TeachOSM, Richard, Steven, and Nuala have a few targets in mind. One of these is to maintain and improve relationships with organizations such as the American Geographical Society (AGS), which oftentimes serve as conveners of educators and those with an interest in mapping, who could benefit from the materials TeachOSM provides. Another is the development of technology -- as programs are developed to help use and incorporate open mapping within the educational community, more people are likely to benefit. This is a constant work in progress, and tools such as the sandbox feature and OSMCha will be able to provide teachers with more resources that can facilitate grading mapping tasks with ease. The third and final goal is the continued creation of content. This encompasses how-to's, guides, references, and more.

Needless to say, TeachOSM has been instrumental in engaging students and educators with OpenStreetMap and GIS in its ten years. What is left to be seen now is how many more people will take advantage of the constantly evolving resources and materials available to them, and what they are able to do with a new skill set in OSM. Hopefully, they will go on to teach others.
