Hi, my name is Hayden MacLachlan, and I am the current communications intern for TeachOSM. As a student at George Washington University, I am pursuing my final semester as an International Affairs major with a minor in Geographic Information Systems. My exposure and passion for mapping developed at a late stage in my academic career. As a junior, I had no prior knowledge of mapping, GIS, or Open-Source technologies. It was the recommendation of a regional geography course instructor that I attended a mapping event with the GW branch of YouthMappers, The Humanitarian Mapping Society (HMS GW). At the time I often felt disconnected from the world I studied. And suddenly, I had the tools to contribute to meaningful data creation. The overlap between my interests and values in real-world problem solving were encouraged. 

Since then, I have joined the executive board of HMS GW, where I manage training for new members and provide collaborative support to the organization. Through bi-weekly Mapathons, we focus on issue areas ranging from climate change to agricultural needs, and natural disaster planning and management projects. 

My familiarity with OSM lead me to TeachOSM, where I now feel my contributions can assist in furthering the geographic and technical proficiency of students and educators. I am excited to pass along the importance of OSM to others and very much look forward to working with this community in the coming months.
