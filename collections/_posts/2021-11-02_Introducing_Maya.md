My name is Maya Lovo, I’m starting as the new communications and outreach intern through the Everywhere She Maps program, that seeks to include women and nonbinary chapter members in the geospatial industry. As part of the TeachOSM team I’ll be assisting the Map-Along project and the monthly programmed activities to further engage the community.
Raised in El Salvador, I developed an interest in environmental and social issues happening in the territory. Currently, as an undergrad student of Socio Spatial Analysis in Mexico City, with peers from the bachelor’s program, we founded the UAMaps chapter (YouthMappers). Even though the project is new, we have already transferred knowledge of open-source programs to local communities through a series of workshops.

Additionally, I participated in the Third Women’s Parliament of Mexico City and worked closely with legislation of the state. Finally, as part of my growing interest in Open-Source GIS, I’m participating in the Women in Geospatial + Mentorship Programme. Through these activities, I want to improve my personal skills, communicate, and engage others in open-source mapping and improve access to data and platforms in the region.
