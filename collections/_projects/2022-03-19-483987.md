  description: "We started mapping buildings in Irbid City, Jordan, a few years ago, but there were some delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are resuming the work with help from YUMappers at Yarmouk University, Jordan. We aim at mapping all buildings in the city remotely and then map important entities during field mapping. "
