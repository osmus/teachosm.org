  description: "By telling us where things are, maps help us find what is missing. In this lesson, students will learn to apply this principle through a service learning project in OpenStreetMap. Data created through this lesson serves to support the work of organizations like KABOOM! who use OpenStreetMap data to understand and communicate neighborhood needs for play areas. In this lesson, students will have the opportunity to learn and discuss the importance of playspace equity and its geographic implications, map play spaces in OpenStreetMap for real-world impact, and (optionally) have the opportunity to add local knowledge on playground quality to the map.
