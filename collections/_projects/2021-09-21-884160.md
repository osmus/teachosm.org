  description: "The Tasking Manager is a key tool in the OpenStreetMap ecosystem because it helps organize a group of mappers working in the same place at the same time. It divides the mapping task into small, manageable chunks and prevents overlapping mapping efforts. The Tasking Manager is often the start and finish of a mapping task making it a critical tool to learn and use.  The tool allows groups and organizations to highlight which areas of the world need volunteers to map for different purposes. For example, a humanitarian organization might use the Tasking Manager to ask volunteers to map roads in the Caribbean following a hurricane to assist with recovery efforts. "
