  description: "By now your students have their OpenStreetMap accounts, and are familiar with the OpenStreetMap interface, have located an area of interest, and are ready to map. In this module, we take control of the iD editor and learn to add geographic data to the map. At the end of this module, your students will be able to add simple features to OpenStreetMap, give those features descriptive 'tags', navigate the iD interface to personalize controls, and understand how to use iD Editor's Help facility."
