  description: "Buildings on OpenStreetMap are indicative of social and economic activity, so they are fundamental to the map. And because of they are relatively easy to add to the map, they are the best way to introduce new mappers to OpenStreetMap.\n\nThis worksheet is developed to guides users with little to no experience through the process of making their first edits on OpenStreetMap by adding buildings.
