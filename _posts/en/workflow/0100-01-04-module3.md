#STEP 3: Conducting Training
##Develop training schedule
It's important that students are comfortable with the assignment and the applications they will use.  Two class sessions are often sufficient to accomplish this.  

Session 1: Begin with an introductory lecture on the assignment. Brief the students on the background to the topics, it's goals and objectives. Introduce them first to OSM and then the tasking manager, and begin with a short hands-on demo with both applications. We had found it's a good idea to have student begin with simple tracing close to home, ven before delving into Tasking Manager.

If you are working with a partner, have them give a short presentation on their overarching project, and the role the students will play in it's completion.  This will give greater context and adds gravitas to the assignment.  

Session 2: This should consist of hands-on tracing on the designated task, gaining experience with the in browser editor, and fielding questions.  After this class the students should be comfortable enough to work individually.

Mapping Party: Finally, host a ‘mapping party’, if possible.  This event is meant to be fun, social and a chance for those involved to come together and work through their assignment.  As an incentive for participation, offer food and drinks if your facility/organization can support it. You can even set up a music play list.

This is a sample presentation that can be modified to incorporate the location and parameters of your particular assessment. It hits all the key points in account creation, tracing, tagging, and tracking work in the TaskingManager.

Student Training Video
This is a sample training video, highlighting a class project for Harare, Zimbabwe. Please feel free to use this video as a teaching aide.
Please note, this video using the HOT Tasking Manager, rather than they TeachOSM Tasking Manager, but they function in exactly the same manor.

##Student Tracing Guide
This guide was developed by USAID in 2013, to support students participating in the Kathmandu OSM Project at The George Washington University. Though the examples and screenshots are specific to infrastructure in that city, the lessons on tracing technique, when presented with building infrastructure of varying density, are applicable in many cases.

##Student Workflow Cheat sheet
This 'cheat sheet' is a one page synopsis of the steps necessary to complete the assignment.  This handout is optional, but many students have found it to be a useful aide, until they are confident with the workflow.
