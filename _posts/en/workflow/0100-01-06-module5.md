# STEP 5: Grading & Quality Control
##Grading

Grading contributions to OSM can be a challenge.  Students must be compensated fairly for their work, and instructors should be conscious that the quality of work contributed to OSM is of a high standard.  

One way to tackle these concerns is to apply the rubric suggested here:

* Completeness: The overall grade is weighted on the completeness of the task.  If only half the assigned work is completed it will be weighted at 50%.
* Quality: This element grades the overall quality of the tracing, for instance, are the corners of the buildings square, and do they match the building footprint accurately, or are roads connected properly.
* Coverage: did the student exhaust all of the possible features in the area/cell they chose?  We want to avoid gaps of infrastructure in OSM. Sometimes students will move from cell to cell, and essentially "cherrypick" the easiest features in each. Assigning a grade for good coverage disencourages this activity.

By enforcing a rubric like this, you can ensure a higher quality of work from your students and to the OSM community.

To help manage and monitor the contributions to OSM, the website Overpass-Turbo (http://overpass-turbo.eu/) can be used.  This website can identify the contributions to OSM by a specific student by searching for that students OSM display name.  To do so, follow the steps below:

* Go to http://overpass-turbo.eu/
* Zoom to the area you wish to check
* Use the Wizard  to search for the student's OSM display name (user:osmname)
* The number of points, lines and polygons created by the user will be noted in the bottom right corner and the features will be highlighted on the screen.

### Informal Quality Control

If you are not working in a traditional classroom setting where the idea of grading is inappropriate, you must still take the quality of the traced map material into consideration.   Consider spot checking the groups work and/or a peer review of the work completed by the group with students fixing mistakes they find.
