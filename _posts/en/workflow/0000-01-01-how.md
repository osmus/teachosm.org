In the section, "How to build your workflow" educators are invited to build their own OSM assignment using tried and tested steps from the "workflows" of educators who've used OSM in the past. 

Individual instructors can use the materials provided verbatim, or, they can take and modify these materials to develop assignments for their particular discipline and curricular needs. 

In the next section we will instruct how to best identify, assign, manage and grade (if applicable) a mapping assignment.
