## About the iD editor

The OpenStreetMap project supports several editors. For this text, we've employed the [iD Editor](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/ID) as the editor of choice because of it's ease-of-use, limited barriers to entry, and simplicity of design. If you're interested in more information on how to use iD or technical specifications, please refer to the [iD](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/ID) page on the OpenStreetMap wiki.
