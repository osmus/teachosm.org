The examples in this guide have relied on the [iD editor](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/ID). However, the Java OpenStreetMap editor, or [JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/) is a nice compliment to iD, especially for more complex tasks. While JOSM has a more robust set of features, it also has a steeper learning curve. But for some advanced tasks, -such as managing relations (a special type of geographic data), it is indispensable.
